This is a demo application being developed on my YouTube channel "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCthZ3lC5jl6iyrF6UvFEiHw" 
the files are completely free to use. The repository will be completely replaced when code is changed or added to.

Just copy all of the files to whatever working directory you wish to use. Then start the Lazarus development environment and
select "Open Project". Navigate to the "myapplication.lpi" file and open it. The project's files will appear in the Lazarus 
source code editor window.

This is the code as it existed before and during the Part 9 video.

Have fun.
