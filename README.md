This is a demo application being developed on my YouTube channel "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCthZ3lC5jl6iyrF6UvFEiHw" The files are completely free to use. The repository archive will be completely replaced when code is changed or added to.

Just copy the ZIP archive file to whatever working directory you wish to use. Unzip the archive Then start the Lazarus development environment and
select "Open Project". Navigate to the "myapplication.lpi" file and open it. The project's files will appear in the Lazarus source code editor window.

Have fun.
